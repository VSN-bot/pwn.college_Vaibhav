# Practicing Piping
## Redirecting output
In this challenge, you must use this output redirection to write the word PWN (all uppercase) to the filename COLLEGE (all uppercase).

Learned about redirecting output.

## Redirecting more output

Aside from redirecting the output of echo, you can, of course, redirect the output of any command. In this level, /challenge/run will once more give you a flag, but only if you redirect its output to the file myflag. Your flag will, of course, end up in the myflag file!

Learned about redirecting more output.

## Redirecting errors
Let's put this into practice! In this challenge, you will need to redirect the output of /challenge/run, like before, to myflag, and the "errors" (in our case, the instructions) to instructions. You'll notice that nothing will be printed to the terminal, because you have redirected everything! You can find the instructions/feedback in instructions and the flag in myflag when you successfully pull this off!

## Redirecting more output

Aside from redirecting the output of echo, you can, of course, redirect the output of any command. In this level, /challenge/run will once more give you a flag, but only if you redirect its output to the file

myflag. Your flag will, of course, end up in the myflag file!

Learned about redirecting more output.

## Appending output
To practice, run /challenge/run with an append-mode redirect of the output to the file /home/hacker/the-flag. The practice will write the first half of the flag to the file, and the second half to stdout if 

stdout is redirected to the file. If you properly redirect in append-mode, the second half will be appended to the first, but if you redirect in truncation mode (>), the second half will overwrite the first and

you won't get the flag!

Learned about appending output.

## Redirecting input
You can do interesting things with a lot of different programs using input redirection! In this level, we will practice using /challenge/run, which will require

you to redirect the PWN file to it and have the PWN file contain the value COLLEGE! To write that value to the PWN file, recall the prior challenge on output 

redirection from echo!

Learned about redirecting input.

## Grepping stored results
In preparation for more complex levels, we want you to:

Redirect the output of /challenge/run to /tmp/data.txt. This will result in a hundred thousand lines of text, with one of them being the flag, in /tmp/data.txt. grep that for the flag!

Learned about grepping stored results inside files.

## Grepping live output
Now try it for yourself! /challenge/run will output a hundred thousand lines of text, including the flag. grep for the flag!

Learned about grepping output.

## Grepping errors
The shell has a >& operator, which redirects a file descriptor to another file descriptor. This means that we can have a two-step process to grep through errors: first, we redirect standard error to standard output (2>& 1) and then pipe the now-combined stderr and stdout as normal (|)!

Learned about grepping errors.

## Filtering with grep -v
Sometimes, the only way to filter to just the data you want is to filter out the data you don't want. In this challenge, /challenge/run will output the flag to stdout, but it will also output over 1000 decoy flags (containing the word DECOY somewhere in the flag) mixed in with the real flag. You'll need to filter out the decoys while keeping the real flag!

Learned about filtering with grep using -v.

## Process substitution for input
This process' /challenge/pwn must be piped into /challenge/college, but you'll need to intercept the data to see what pwn needs from you!

Learned about process substitution.

## Writing to multiple programs
In this challenge, we have /challenge/hack, /challenge/the, and /challenge/planet. Run the /challenge/hack command, and duplicate its output as input to both the /challenge/the and the /challenge/planet 

commands!

Learned about writing to multiple programs.

## Split-piping stderr and stdout
In this challenge, you have:

/challenge/hack: this produces data on stdout and stderr /challenge/the: you must redirect hack's stderr to this program /challenge/planet: you must redirect hack's stdout to this program Go get the flag!

Learned about split piping for errors and outputs.

## Named pipes
This challenge will be a simple introduction to FIFOs. You'll need to create a /tmp/flag_fifo file and redirect the stdout of /challenge/run to it. If you're successful, /challenge/run will write the flag into the FIFO! Go do it!

HINT: The blocking behavior of FIFOs makes it hard to solve this challenge in a single terminal. You may want to use the Desktop or VSCode mode for this challenge

so that you can launch two terminals.
