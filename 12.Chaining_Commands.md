# Chaining Commands
## Chaining with Semicolons
Give it a try now! In this level, you must run /challenge/pwn and then /challenge/college, chaining them with a semicolon.

### New Learnings
Learned about chaining with semicolons.

## Building on Success
In this challenge, you need to chain the programs /challenge/first-success and /challenge/second using the && operator. Try running each command separately first to 

see what happens (which is that you will not get the flag). But if you chain them with &&, the flag will appear!

### New Learnings
Learned about building on success using &&.

## Handling Failure
In this challenge, you need to chain /challenge/first-failure and /challenge/second using the || operator. Go for it!

### New Learnings
Learned about handling failure ||.

## Your First Shell Script
Same as last level, run /challenge/pwn and then /challenge/college, but this time in a shell script called x.sh, then run it with bash!

Solve

### New Learnings
Learned about shell script.

## Redirecting Script Output
In this level, we will practice piping (|) from your script to another program. Like before, you need to create a script that calls the /challenge/pwn command

followed by the /challenge/college command, and pipe the output of the script into a single invocation of the /challenge/solve command!

### New Learnings

Learned about shell script output.

## Executable Shell Scripts
Make a shellscript that will invoke /challenge/solve, make it executable, and run it without explicitly invoking bash!

### New Learnings
Learned about executing shell scripts.

## Understanding Shebangs
For this challenge, create a script at /home/hacker/solve.sh that has a proper shebang and outputs "hack the planet". Remember to make it executable, then run

/challenge/run to verify your script works correctly!

### New Learnings
Learned about shebangs.
## Scripting with Arguments
For this challenge, you need to write a script at /home/hacker/solve.sh that:

Takes two arguments Outputs them in REVERSE order (second argument first, then the first argument)

### New Learnings
Learned about scripting with arguments.

## Scripting with Conditionals

For this challenge, write a script at /home/hacker/solve.sh that:

Takes one argument If the argument is "pwn", output "college" For any other input, output nothing

Solve

### New Learnings
Learned about scripting with conditionals.

## Scripting with Default Cases
For this challenge, write a script at /home/hacker/solve.sh that:

Takes one argument If the argument is "pwn", output "college" For any other input, output "nope"

Solve

### New Learnings
Learned about scripting with default cases.

## Scripting with Multiple Conditions
For this challenge, write a script at /home/hacker/solve.sh that:

Takes one argument If the argument is "hack", output "the planet" If the argument is "pwn", output "college" If the argument is "learn", output "linux" For any

other input, output "unknown"

### New Learnings

Learned about scripting with multiple conditions.

## Reading Shell Scripts
In this level, we will learn to read shell scripts. /challenge/run is a shell script that requires you to put in a secret password, but that password is hardcoded 

into the script iself! Read the script (using, say, cat), figure out the password, and get the flag!
