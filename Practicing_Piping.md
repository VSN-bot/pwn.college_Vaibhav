Learned about redirecting output.

## Redirecting more output

Aside from redirecting the output of echo, you can, of course, redirect the output of any command. In this level, /challenge/run will once more give you a flag, but only if you redirect its output to the file myflag. Your flag will, of course, end up in the myflag file!

Learned about redirecting more output.

## Redirecting errors
Let's put this into practice! In this challenge, you will need to redirect the output of /challenge/run, like before, to myflag, and the "errors" (in our case, the instructions) to instructions. You'll notice that nothing will be printed to the terminal, because you have redirected everything! You can find the instructions/feedback in instructions and the flag in myflag when you successfully pull this off!

Learned about redirecting more output.

## Appending output
To practice, run /challenge/run with an append-mode redirect of the output to the file /home/hacker/the-flag. The practice will write the first half of the flag to the file, and the second half to stdout if 

stdout is redirected to the file. If you properly redirect in append-mode, the second half will be appended to the first, but if you redirect in truncation mode (>), the second half will overwrite the first and

you won't get the flag!
