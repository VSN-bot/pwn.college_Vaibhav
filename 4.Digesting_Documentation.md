## Help for Builtins
In this challenge, we'll practice using help to look up help for builtins. This challenge's challenge command is a shell builtin, rather than a program. Like

before, you need to lookup its help to figure out the secret value to pass to it!

## Searching For Manuals

This level is tricky: it hides the manpage for the challenge by randomizing its name. Luckily, all of the manpages are gathered in a searchable database, so you'll

be able to search the man page database to find the hidden challenge man page! To figure out how to search for the right manpage, read the man page manpage by 

doing: man man!
