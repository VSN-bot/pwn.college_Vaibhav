# Processes and Jobs
## Listing Processes
In this level, I have once again renamed /challenge/run to a random filename, and this time made it so that you cannot ls the /challenge directory! But I also launched
it, so you can find it in the running process list, figure out the filename, and relaunch it directly for the flag! Good luck!

Learned about listing processes.

## Killing Processes
Now, it's time to terminate your first process! In this challenge, /challenge/run will refuse to run while /challenge/dont_run is running! You must find the dont_run
process and kill it. If you fail, pwn.college will disavow all knowledge of your mission. Good luck.

Learned about killing processes.

## Interrupting Processes
Try it here! /challenge/run will refuse to give you the flag until you interrupt it. Good luck!

Learned about interrupting processes.

## Suspending Processes
This level's run wants to see another copy of itself running and using the same terminal. How? Use the terminal to launch it, then suspend it, then launch another

copy while the first is suspended!

Learned about suspending processes.

## Resuming Processes
This challenge's run needs you to suspend it, then resume it. Good luck!

Learned about resuming processes.

## Backgrounding Processes
This level's run wants to see another copy of itself running, not suspended, and using the same terminal. How? Use the terminal to launch it, then suspend it,

then background it with bg and launch another copy while the first is running in the background!

Learned about backgrounding processes.

## Foregrounding Processes
Imagine that you have a backgrounded process, and you want to mess with it some more. What do you do? Well, you can foreground a backgrounded process with fg 

just like you foreground a suspended process! This level will walk you through that!

Learned about foregrounding processes.

## Starting Background Processes
Launch /challenge/run backgrounded for the flag by appending &!

Learned about starting background processes.

## Process Exit Codes
In this challenge, you must retrieve the exit code returned by /challenge/get-code and then run /challenge/submit-code with that error code as an argument.
Good luck!

Learned about exit codes.

## Killing Misbehaving Processes
Your general workflow should be:

Check what processes are running. Find /challenge/decoy in the list and figure out its process ID. kill it. Run /challenge/run to get the flag without being overwhelmed by decoys (you don't need to redirect its output; it'll write to the FIFO on its own). Good luck!
