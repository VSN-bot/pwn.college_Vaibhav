# WriteUps for HelloHackers Module from pwn.college

## Hello Hackers

### Intro to Commands

In this level, invoke the hello command to get the flag! Keep in mind: commands in Linux are case sensitive: hello is different from HELLO. 

#### Solve

Flag: pwn.college{43-VY3cbEuGLNTkfEodRSH-wo9v.QX3YjM1wCNwCzNzEzW}
```bash
hello
```

To solve this, I entered hello in the terminal and invoked the hello command and got the flag


### Intro to Arguments

In this challenge, to get the flag, you must run the hello command (NOT the echo command) with a single argument of hackers. Try it now! 

#### Solve

Flag: pwn.college{47iwCy-3iOVgT044o2tnDmEFfi-.QX4YjM1wCNwCzNzEzW}
``` bash
hello hackers
```

We were supposed to run the hacker argumnet using the hello command, the first word is the command and next words are arguments so its a single line statement.

Learnt about arguments and commands.

### Command History

You're going to type a lot of commands, and typing everything from scratch can be annoying. Luckily, the shell saves a history of every command you invoke. 

#### Solve

Flag: pwn.college{sk5Tjirv8SVIqRwHmQOzmdUnM5E.0lNzEzNxwiNzAzNzEzW}

I used the up arrow to access the previous command and it had the flag.

Learned the usefulness of up/down arrow keys to re-use commands.
