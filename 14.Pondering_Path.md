# Pondering Path
## The PATH Variable
In this level, you will disrupt the operation of the /challenge/run program. This program will DELETE the flag file using the rm command. However, if it can't find 

the rm command, the flag will not be deleted, and the challenge will give it to you! Thus, you must make it so that /challenge/run also can't find the rm command!

Learned about the PATH variable.

## Setting PATH
This level's /challenge/run will run the win command via its bare name, but this command exists in the /challenge/more_commands/ directory, which is not initially in

the PATH. The win command is the only thing that /challenge/run needs, so you can just overwrite PATH with that one directory. Good luck!

Finding Commands
In this challenge, we added a win command somewhere in your $PATH, but it won't give you the flag. Instead, it's in the same directory as a flag file that we made

readable by you! You must find win (with the which command), and cat the flag out of that directory!
