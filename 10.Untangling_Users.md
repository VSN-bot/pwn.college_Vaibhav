## Becoming root with su
This challenge (and only this challenge) does have a root password. That password is hack-the-planet, and you must provide it to su to become root! Go do that, and read the flag!

## Cracking passwords
This level simulates this story, giving you a leak of /etc/shadow (in /challenge/shadow-leak). Crack it (this could take a few minutes), su to zardus, and run /challenge/run to get the flag!
